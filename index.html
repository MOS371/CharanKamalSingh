							<h4 class="about-sub-heading">My name is Charan Kamal Singh.<h4>
							<h5>I am a Student and lives in Toronto, Canada.</h5>
							<p class="about-text">I am a native of jammu&Kashmir, which is the northern part of India. I came here to Canada in 2019, to attain my dreamâ€™s which is to get a better education and to be successful in my life, I completed my 12th in 2017 and decided to do higher studies, after doing research and studies about some colleges in India I decided to study in my home city, but the decision is not quite good as the education system in India is less effective and boring. So, after that I decide to do my higher studies abroad, So, I chose this program and the college to fulfill my dream as the Canadian education system is much effective and easier to learn. Talking about my hobbies, traveling is my first favorite thing as I am very keen to find a new place and to meet new people and to learn their culture, ethnicity, and life. Reading books is my other hobby as books are the treasure of knowledge and reading a book helps me to gain knowledge and spend my free time. </p>

				<h3 class="project-heading">Flipgrid Assignment Description</h3>
				This Flip Grid assignment challenges us to figure out where we stand and what we're thinking about in terms of life, the future, and our dream. This is a 90-second speech about our life and dream. Since speaking in front of a large group of people is challenging, this challenge boosts morale. However, this technology and the flip grid assignment provide us with a new space that is beyond our classroom.Since we use a camera in our everyday lives, this new challenge is really creative for me. The flip grid assignment introduces us to a new world outside of our classrooms. This assignment has given me confidence and improved my speaking abilities.

				Knowledge: This flip grid assignment has improved my understanding of a new media medium called flip grid video.
				
				Confidence: This assignment gives me the confidence to say whatever I want, and it also teaches me how to develop my basic communication skills while talking to or listening to others.
